This project aims to develop a customer segmentation model using a marketing campaign dataset. By leveraging demographic information (such as age, income, and family size), purchase history (amount spent on different product categories), and engagement with marketing campaigns, it aims to identify distinct customer groups. These segments can help the company design personalized marketing campaigns and improve product offerings.
